description: Bootstrap or evolve the Go infrastructure scope of an SDD project — module layout, verification gates via the stack plugin system (gennady verify), gennady.config.json overrides, toolchain diagnostics. Use when the scope is a Go service or library, especially brownfield monorepos where `./...` is too slow to be a per-phase gate. Also use to diagnose why Go gates fail or lie.

<SddInfraGolang>

Go specialisation of `sdd-infra`. Scope-type is fixed: `infrastructure`; language is fixed: `go`.

The deterministic half of this skill is the stack plugin system — **one verb for every stack**: `gennady verify`. The golang plugin carries the Go knowledge; the repo's deviations live in `gennady.config.json` (section `stack`; personal `.gennadyrc` overrides it), never in ad-hoc per-repo commands. Read `ai/directives/infra/golang-setup.xml` for the reasoning behind every rule below.

## 1. Orient before designing

Never propose Go tooling for a repository you have not inspected. Run:

```bash
npx gennady verify --plan
```

This prints, without executing anything:

- which stacks were detected (a repo can be node + golang at once)
- module path and `go` directive; nested modules `./...` cannot reach
- `go.work` / vendoring — which decides the module flag
- the golangci config actually found, including non-dot names like `golangci.yml`
- toolchain diagnostics (notably Go-version skew that makes golangci-lint panic)
- the exact argv of every gate that would run

Machine-readable form for a subagent: `npx gennady verify --plan --json`.

## 2. Read the diagnostics honestly

| Diagnostic | Meaning | Correct response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GOLANGCI_GO_TOO_OLD` | Linter binary predates the module's Go; it will panic, not lint | Install a newer golangci-lint, or `gennady.config.json: {"stack":{"golang":{"skip":["lint"]}}}` |
| `GOLANGCI_CONFIG_MISSING` | Makefile points at a config absent from the checkout | Restore it, or set `lintConfig` in the stack config |
| `NESTED_MODULES` | Nested `go.mod` outside `./...` | Verify each with `--root=<dir>`, or state which modules are uncovered |
| `STACK_CONFIG_INVALID` | Stack config is broken JSON or wrong shape | Fix it; verify degraded to auto-detection meanwhile |

## 3. Wire the gate into the SDD loop

The per-phase gate, run from the module root:

```bash
npx gennady verify
```

Golang defaults to the packages changed against the base branch — staged, unstaged and untracked. On a monorepo this is the difference between a 12-second gate and a CI-scale job.

Narrow or widen deliberately:

```bash
npx gennady verify internal/userapi      # explicit target
npx gennady verify --all                 # whole module — slow
npx gennady verify --only=build,vet      # fast inner loop
npx gennady verify --skip=lint           # documented, visible skip
npx gennady verify --tidy                # add go.mod drift check
npx gennady verify --stack=golang        # ignore other detected stacks
```

Contract (all stacks): **RUN-ALL** · **SUPPRESS-ON-SUCCESS** · exit `0` all pass, `1` gate failed, `4` bad invocation, `5` no stack detected.

## 4. Encode repo deviations in `gennady.config.json`, not in prose

When a repo verifies differently (Makefile targets, codegen drift checks, custom timeouts), declare it **once, in the repo**:

```json
{
  "stack": {
    "golang": {
      "skip": ["lint"],
      "testTimeout": "10m",
      "gates": { "test": { "argv": ["make", "test"] } },
      "extraGates": [{ "id": "codegen-drift", "argv": ["make", "check-generated"] }]
    }
  }
}
```

Application order: plugin plan → `gates` overrides → `skip` → `extraGates`. An extra gate must be non-mutating like every other gate.

## 5. Distinguish FAIL from ENV_FAIL — this is the important one

- **`FAIL`** — the tool ran and found a problem in the code. Fix the code.
- **`ENV_FAIL`** — the tool could not run: a `panic:`, a golangci-lint exit above 1, a refused dependency fetch. **The code is not implicated.** Do not edit sources in response; fix the environment or skip the gate explicitly.

An agent that "fixes" code in response to `ENV_FAIL` produces confident, wrong diffs. Report it to the operator and stop rather than guessing.

## 6. Rules that survive contact with real repositories

Full reasoning in `ai/directives/infra/golang-setup.xml`; the short form:

1. **One verb, every stack.** Differences go into `gennady.config.json`, not into new commands.
2. **Gates never mutate.** `gofmt -l`, never `go fmt`; `go mod tidy -diff`, never `tidy`.
3. **Scope before depth.** Changed packages by default; `./...` on request only.
4. **Lint config passed via `-c`** — auto-discovery misses bare `golangci.yml` (mailapi).
5. **`-mod=vendor` when vendored** — offline, reproducible; never together with `go.work`.
6. **`./...` stops at module boundaries** — nested modules need their own run.
7. **Bound the tests** — explicit `-timeout`; integration tests behind build tags are a separate, explicit scope.

## 7. Designing a new Go infra scope

When the operator wants tooling *designed* rather than merely run:

1. **Extract intent.** Confirm scope-type=`infrastructure`, language=`go`. Resolve the scope name (e.g. `infra-golang`).
2. **Load & activate.** Read in full: `~/Developer/gennady/ai/directives/sdd/discovery.directive.xml`, then `~/Developer/gennady/ai/directives/infra/golang-setup.xml`.
   Announce: `🔒 DIRECTIVE ACTIVATED: SddDiscovery | infrastructure | golang`
3. **Ground every requirement in observed state** — the `--plan --json` output above, not assumptions about how Go projects usually look.
4. **Apply.** Follow the discovery Execution_Plan end-to-end. Every proposed gate must be expressible as a `gennady verify` invocation or a `gennady.config.json` entry — or justified as to why it is not.
